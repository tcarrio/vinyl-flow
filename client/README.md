# StreamerClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

It is the Angular web app in relation to my work on the at-home hardware-based streaming service actionable from Google Home to play across Chromecast devices.

This exposes an API for interacting with the stream service, and is deployed on the hardware connected to the device to stream.
